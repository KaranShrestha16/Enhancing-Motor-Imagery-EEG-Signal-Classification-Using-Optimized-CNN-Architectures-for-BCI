## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications by improving the classification of Motor Imagery (MI) EEG signals. The study initially developed a Baseline CNN model as a starting point, evaluated multiple architectures, and selected the best-performing model for enhancement. The Enhanced CNN model was further optimized and extended for binary classification tasks.
